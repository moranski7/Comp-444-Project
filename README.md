# Comp-444-Project

My project for Embedded/Robotic Programming (COMP 444) from Athabasca University.
This is my first project that I designed, started and completed by myself.

The hardware for the project:
FIRST HALF
1x Arduino/Genuino Uno 1x Sparkfun baseplate 1x Motor driver 2x Gear motors 2x Wheels 14x jumper wires 1x battery holder 4x AA batteries 1x Dual lock tape

SECOND HALF
1x Arduino/Genuino Uno 1x Switch 2x LED 3x 330 Ohm resistor 1x LM 386 Sound Sensor 1x Adafruit Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466 with Adjustable Gain 12x Jumper Wires 3x Male/Female Jumper Wires 4x Jumper Wires

The set up can be found in <a url="https://github.com/moranski7/Comp-444-Project/blob/master/Michael%20Oransi%202743708%20Project.pdf">Michael Oransi 2743708 Project.pdf</a>

The project make use of I2C_Anything library found at https://github.com/nickgammon/I2C_Anything.

What works:
- Sound detect (somewhat)
- movement behavoir
- PID feedback
